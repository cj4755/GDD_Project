This projects aims to deliver graphical information of growing degree days (GDD) for different cities in Canada along the years. The code basically takes values of temperature available on the canadian climate repository (http://climate.weather.gc.ca) for several cities for specific years and delivers a variety of visual information: graphics of maximum and minimum temperatures for each city, acumulated GDD for each city in different time frame, plots of how GDD calculation depends on the choice of T_base, and maps for acumulated GDD around Canada for selected years.
