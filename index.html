#**introduction**:

 GDD are a measure of heat accumulation used by horticulturists, gardeners,  and farmers to predict plant and animal development rates such as t he date  that a flower will bloom, or a crop will reach maturity.


 GDD are calculated by taking the average of the daily maximum and minimum t emperatures compared to a base temperature, Tbase, (usually 10 °C).
 

 GDDs are typically measured from the winter low. Any temperature below Tbase is set to Tbase before calculating the average. Likewise, the maximum temperature is usually capped at 30 °C because most plants and insects do not grow any faster above that temperature```

We calculated the Growing Degree Days for six cities in Canada from 2002-05/2016.

#**list of the cities**: 


1.*St.john's*,Newfoundland.

2.*Vancouver*,British Columbia.

3.*Regina*,Saskatchewan.

4.*Saskatoon*,Saskatchewan.

5.*Montreal*,Quebec.

6.*Toronto*,Ontario.
